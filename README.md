In this project, I worked on visualizing and analyzing sales data for a company called Superstore, which has locations across the United States. My task was to show all store locations, calculate total sales and revenue, and analyze sales patterns by month. I did that, and I also explored which payment methods were most popular, identified best-selling products, and tracked shipping times for online orders. To achieve this, I cleaned and organized the data using a spreadsheet, removing duplicates and correcting errors. After cleaning the data, I transferred it to Power BI and used Power Query to create some condition columns, merge and append some tables, change data types, and make the data ready for visuals. Then, I created a slicer to filter by four zones (East, West, South, and Central), a map showing sales by store location, and various charts to display total sales, revenue, and delivery times. I also included visualizations like a stacked area chart for monthly sales, a donut chart for payment methods, and bar charts for sales by category and shipping duration. Finally, I built a sales forecast for the next 15 days and uploaded the report.
